.TH DPKG\-QUERY 1 "August 2001" "Debian Project" "dpkg suite"
.SH NAME
dpkg\-query \- a tool to query the dpkg database

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dpkg\-query

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdpkg\-query\fP is a tool to show information about packages listed in
the \fBdpkg\fP database.


.SH COMMANDS
.TP
\fB\-l\fP | \fB\-\-list\fP \fIpackage-name-pattern\fP ...
List packages matching given pattern. If no \fIpackage-name-pattern\fP
is given, list all packages in \fI/var/lib/dpkg/status\fP.  Normal
shell wildchars are allowed in \fIpackage-name-pattern\fP. Please note
you will probably have to quote \fIpackage-name-pattern\fP to prevent
the shell from performing filename expansion. For example this will
list all package names starting with \*(lqlibc5\*(rq:

.T
.nf
  \fBdpkg\-query \-l 'libc5*'\fP
.fi
.TP
\fB\-W\fP | \fB\-\-show\fP \fIpackage-name-pattern\fP ...
Just like the \fB\-\-list\fP option this will list all packages matching
the given pattern. However the output can be customized using the
\fB\-\-showformat\fP option.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP | \fB\-\-status\fP \fIpackage-name\fP ...
Report status of specified package. This just displays the entry in
the installed package status database.
.TP
\fB\-L\fP | \fB\-\-listfiles\fP \fIpackage\fP ...
List files installed to your system from \fBpackage\fP.
However, note that files created by package-specific
installation-scripts are not listed.
.TP
\fB\-S\fP | \fB\-\-search\fP \fIfilename-search-pattern\fP ...
Search for a filename from installed packages. All standard shell
wildchars can be used in the pattern.  This command will not list
extra files created by maintainer scripts, nor will it list
alternatives.
.TP
\fB\-p\fP |\fB\-\-print\-avail\fP package
Display details about \fIpackage\fP, as found in
\fI/var/lib/dpkg/available\fP.
.TP
\fB\-\-licence\fP | \fB\-\-license\fP
Display licence and copyright information.
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fP
Display version information.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-admindir=\fIdir\fP
Change the location of the \fBdpkg\fR database. The default location is
\fI/var/lib/dpkg\fP.
.TP
\fB-f\fP | \fB\-\-showformat=\fP\fIformat\fR
This option is used to specify the format of the output \fB\-\-show\fP
will produce.  The format is a string that will be output for each package
listed. It can include the standard escape sequences \en (newline), \er
(carriage return) or \e\e (plain backslash). Package information can be
included by inserting variable references to package fields using the
${var[;width]} syntax. Fields are printed be right-aligned unless the
width is negative in which case left alignment will be used. 

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
\fBCOLUMNS\fP
This setting influences the output of the \fB\-\-list\fP option by changing
the width of its output.
