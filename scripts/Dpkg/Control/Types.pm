=head1 NAME

Dpkg::Control::Types - export CTRL_* constants

=head1 DESCRIPTION

You should not use this module directly. Instead you more likely
want to use Dpkg::Control which also re-exports the same constants.

This module has been introduced solely to avoid a dependency loop
between Dpkg::Control and Dpkg::Control::Fields.
